# Twitch IRC chat client

----
This is a cross-platform chat client for twitch.tv, created with Qt for GUI and libcommuni for backend. This chat client provides some functionalities like emotes, and auto complete for most BTTV, FFZ, and Twitch emotes.

## Dependencies
1.  Qt 5.5 or older, as this chat client uses the (old) QWebView.
2. C++11 compiler or newer.

This project is currently on hold. But if I ever feel like continuing, I will be implementing a split pane chat instead of just multi tab chat. I might also be adding auto complete for users in chat.
